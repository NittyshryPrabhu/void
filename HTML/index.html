When the child turned 5 years old,he was sent to study in a private school .One night that little child starts crying remembering his parents because he is very small and lives in a hostel away from his parents .That night a miss there sang him a lullaby and put him to sleep. But the next day when his parents were told ,they became  very nervous and decided to bring him home.Because Nitty used to cry a lot in the hostel.Not only his friends but his parents loved him very much .Due to which he had to complete his 10th and 12th studies by staying in his village.Till 10th class,Nitty had no knowledge of his existence or not .Meaning he did not think about what he wanted to become when he grew up? what work needs to be done .Due to which he used to study only at that time .And he scored about 86.5 % marks in 10th ,which was a matter of great pride for him and his family. But when he went to 11th ,then he started thinking about what he wants to become and what he wants to do in his life.Due to which he started feeling very sad and disappointed.It is believed that he started thinking a lot about his future.Seeing this his mother getting very upset .But when his mother asked what happened to you son,he would smile and say that nothing happened to me .Just like that.  </p>

        One day he was watching a movie .The characters of that movie got imprinted on his mind and he started  thinking that after all,these people are also human beings who are known by their name and by their work. What is there in that ? which is not in me,by which the whole world knows it.Gradually the thought started coming in his mind that he has to become a bigger person than he is . AT the same time he was also studying  .But as he started thinking why is he in this world ? ,So he thought that one day he too would become such that the whole world would know him by his name and his work. 				Due to which he used to think a lot about how to be made,how to do think a gradually he spent two years in her thoughts and dreams . And he was completely sure that he would become a great man .

But ,He even thought that he could do everything on his own,so when he went to12th ,he didn’t go anywhere for coaching or tuition .He himself started preparing at his home due to which in 12th he got some percentage less than his friends.

          But he got so much that his courage did not break that he could not do anything on his own .His courage did not break.His courage remined intact that he could do anything.
And his mother said after that that  son ,whatever you do ,doit with all your heart , do it with all your heart ,you will definitely get success one day or the other .Mother also sometimes used to listen to her sad things but then she used to say that I told you this because I want you to learn something from it so that this should not happen to you again ,that is why i told you this. but he knew that the mother who was saying this was broken inside , she knew that if she opened up to the little bird and told her heart’s feelings then the little bird might leave her home .

        <p style="margin-left: 300px; margin-right: 600px;" > The story begins like this that a 12 year old boy meets a 12 year old girl for the first time. The boy and the girl met for the first time in the annual examination held for the 6th class in a school. <br>Listen, give me some English books. <br>Yes, yes, take them.<br> And the boy gave her the books. And from here the mystery of love begins. <br>Boy N.. Girl R.. <br> Boy's friend (Babli, Salu, Ruchi, Rana, Prince, Nitish Thakur etc.).<br> Kanchan, Khushi, Komal, Salu, Rani (Girl's friend).<br> R..: - Give me some English book. <br>N...:- What, book, what will you do?<br> R..:- There is a little problem, cheating friend. <br>Boy - ok, take it, print it quickly and give it to me.<br> Girl - ok, give it to me.</p>
       </div>
      
       <div>
        <p style="margin-left: 600px; margin-right: 400px;" >Now the girl's friend felt that the boy and the girl already knew each other. And she started spreading this rumour in the entire class.

         <br> On the other side, the boy's friends also reacted in the same way as the girl's friend and they also started spreading rumours in the entire class.
          
          <br>N.. - Hey brother, nothing is like what you people think.
          <br>Shalu, Ruchi, Nitish, Raja:- Okay, don't tell us. What is going on? We all understand what is going on.
           <br>R..- Hey friends, nothing is like what you people think.
          <br>Kanchan, Khushi, Rani:- Okay, don't tell us. What is going on? We all understand what is going on.</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 300px; margin-right: 700px; margin-top: -250px;" >Now somewhere in the mind of the boy, those things started to seem true and he also started enjoying. When the school was over,

              <br>Boy's friend Nitish:- Why did you take the book from me and give it to her? You did not make her your own.<br> N...Hey friend, it is not like what you people think.
              
              <br>Girl's friend: Yes, how did she give you the book so soon? <br>R..Hey friend, how do I know why she gave it?
              
              <br>Now everyday in the class, they would talk to each other about how she made him her friend.
              
              <br>By the way, among the boys (N..) and among the girls (R..), both of them were completely different from everyone and a little smarter than everyone.
              
             <br> N.. used to get a lot of love from the boys and girls and those talks used to make the boy very happy that "she is your girl".</p>

              <br>N.. felt that R.. has also started knowing him somewhere. Now the class 7th exam started.
               <br>N..'s friend: Do you know the answer of the question, friend?
              <br>N- No, I don't know. I don't have the book, print it.
              <br>N..'s friend: I don't have it, that's why I am asking you. I don't have it, what should I do?
               <br>N..'s friend: Ask R.
               <br>N.. I, from her, will she give it to me, no I won't ask.
               <br>N..'s friend: Ask her once, she gives it to you only.
              <br> N.. Okay, I will ask.
              <br>N.. - R.. give me a little book. I have to see this question.
              <br> Now the girl's friend started understanding that there is something between the two.
              <br> R.. tells N.. to give it quickly.
              <br> Now when R.. gave the book, the boy's friend also started commenting a lot. And would say and do things to some.
             <br> The boy became famous in the whole class and even in the school.

            <p style="margin-left: 300px; margin-right: 700px; margin-top: -200px;" ><br>Then came the annual examination of 7th, 
              <br>one day R.. could not appear in the exam.
               <br>Then all R..'s friends said that 
               <br>Sir, is there a boy like R.. here whose writing is like R.. 
               <br>So R..'s copy was given to N.. 
               <br>and N.. had to make a copy. 
               <br>Here N..'s friend also started enjoying himself.
                <br>N.. was also very happy, seeing all this, N felt that R really likes N somewhere.
               <br>Then in class 8 also the same thing happened as happened in 7th.
               <br>Now we went to class 9th, there
               <br>N had a separate college and R had a separate school. Now the distance between them was too much and N was very shy, maybe he was missing R.
               <br> I don't know why N also felt that R must be missing N. <br>These two never met in 9th and 10th. 
               <br>Then once they met in class 11th, N was very surprised that how could this be possible.
               <br> After 2 years they met again, N started feeling like it happens in movies that true love is always found. N felt the same way.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
           
            <p style="margin-left: 600px; margin-right: 400px;">
              But in 11th and 12th, I never talked to either N R or R N. Actually, there was no such opportunity to help each other. But this is a true story, it is a little difficult to fulfill one's desires and one who does so can endure a lot of pain. N and R never let their desires come out of their hearts. But R knew about N's wishes. But N was not aware of R's wishes. Friends, do you think it was desire or love or attraction. N never knew what this was?But if we look at it that way, that meeting is the beginning of this story. The first time she asks for a book from the R N. Would this story have been possible if R N had not asked for the book? No, not at all. Friend N feels that all this is just mental pain and this pain also reduces with time. So friends, when you are in love with someone, fulfill it and keep doing your duty at the same time.
